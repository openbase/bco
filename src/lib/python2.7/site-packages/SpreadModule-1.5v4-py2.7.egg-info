Description: This package contains a simple Python wrapper module for the Spread
        toolkit.  The wrapper is known to be compatible with Python 2.3 and 2.4.
        It may work with earlier Pythons, but this has not been tested.
        
        Spread (www.spread.org) is a group communications package.  You'll
        need to download and install it separately.  The Python API has been
        built and tested against Spreads 3.16.1 through 3.17.3, although at
        least Spread 3.17 is required to use this version of the wrapper.
        3.17.3 is recommended.
